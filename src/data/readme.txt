Some notes:
- The showreel "bgimg" key refers to the filename in website/public/imgs/showreel.
  Showreel images have to go there, not anywhere in the src/imgs folder.
- Json does not support newlines so strings have to be on one line. You can use
  word wrap in your editor as a visual aid.
- Language translations may be unfinished/unimplemented so don't be confused if
  you see Finnish where English is supposed to be.
