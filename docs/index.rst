This is the documentation for the website of Digitalents Academy. While the
website will be/is used the code was also written as a learning project. That
means there may be some parts (especially older ones) that use strange
structures.


public/index.html
-----------------

Main html template file. Everything the React App renders it inserted into the "root" div
element.

Put externally loaded fonts and other stuff here.
Currently holds a reference to Font Awesome.


src/index.js
------------

React application entry point. You can pretty much just ignore this.


src/index.css
-------------

Holds some global styling information, including font-family definitions.
